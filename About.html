          <p class="text-justify"> Hello, I'm a beginner developer, this is one of my first projects. I've been studying so hard to get all the concepts about web development. Nowadays I'm focusing on the front-end however I get all the concepts at University.</p>
          
          <p> One of my motivation to write this page was that here in Brazil almost no one knows what morse code is. I must confess that a few years ago I didn't know it too. However, after figuring out how fun is to communicate using this tool I started to wonder why everyone around me knows nothing about it. 
          </p>

          <p>
            I learned it in one week, I follow a strategy to first memorize the vowels. So I wrote the a,e,i,o,u many times on a sheet, after that, I started to build few words like home, this way I could keep on my mind also the consonants.  I think that anyone can learn it and the most important, have fun using that. If you start today trying to write the letters, writing a few words I bet that soon you will master it.
          </p>
        
          <p class="text-justify">Here I'll tell you how this page works. I've written the front-end using the framework called bootstrap. It allowed me to finish quickly the elements. On the first page, there is a button that activate the listener behind the scenes.
          </p>
        
          <p class="text-justify">The first action that this listener does is to get the string written in the form. For that, I used DOM manipulation. Then I set this string to a variable called form text which I pass through a parameter to a function called morse code. This <strong>function</strong> runs character by character of this string to check each element, so, if the first element of <strong> formText </strong> is an 'a' the function will write '.-' in a new string. Working this way using a loop I can read any string and translate it to morse code.
